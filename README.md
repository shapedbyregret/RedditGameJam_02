# F*ckin' Magnets

**Description**

Entrant for Reddit Game Jam 02, whose theme is "opposites." To comply with the
theme, I created a game that simulates the naturally occurring opposites of
magnetism. The goal of the game is to move the negatively charged objects
to the yellow goal on the far right of the screen.

** Controls **

Mouse left click to place down positive (attractiing) magnet.
Mouse left click while holding shift to place down negative (repelling) magnet.
Move your mouse to the left and right edges of the screen to scroll.
